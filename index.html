                I’m a graduate in Computer Engineering currently working for Pong Game Studios as Quality Assurance Analyst. At present, I am working on a web-based gaming project that involves testing and automating slot games using User Acceptance Testing techniques under agile methodology.
                <br/>
                I have worked on various software development languages in the past such as C or C++, and currently working on web technologies that involve HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have extensive experience with Software Development Life Cycle system that include requirements collection and gathering, Architecture and Design, Coding, Development, Testing, maintenance and also enhancement in various technological platforms.
                <br/>
                Being in the software industry for the past three years, customer or client satisfaction should always be the topmost priority which I believe can only be achieved or attained through delivering a high-quality product in a timely manner.
